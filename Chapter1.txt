YOU ARE MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL.

i want to apologize to all women 
i have called pretty.
before i've called them intelligent or brave.
i am sorry i made it sound as though
something as simple as what you're born with
is the most you have to be proud of 
when your spirits has crushed the mountains
from now on i will say things like,you are resilient
or,you are extraordinary.
not because i don't think you're pretty.
but because you are so much more than that
